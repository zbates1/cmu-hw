      ­ 14 hackathons, held on Saturdays
      ­ In-person in Pittsburgh and Kigali (room TBD)
      ­ It is a giant office hour session with pizza

· Bootcamps

      ­ 4 bootcamps, one for each HW (+1 for Guided Project)
      ­ Held on Saturdays before hackathon
      ­ It will cover HW implementation specifics while you follow along
               Assignments

· There will be four main HWs, bonus HWs, and an
  autograd bonus

· Main HWs all have two parts:

    ­ Part 1: Autograded problems with deterministic solutions
          · You must upload them to autolab and CHECK YOUR SCORE

    ­ Part 2: Open problems posted on Kaggle

· HW Bonus and Autograd Bonus:

     ­ There will be bonus homeworks associated with some (or all)
         of the homeworks; there will also be a separate autograd
         bonus homework.

     ­ These marks will not contribute to final grading curves and
         give you the chance to make up for marks missed elsewhere
              Study Groups

· Everyone must join a study group
· Each study group will be assigned a TA mentor

   for help throughout the course
· We recommend study groups of 3-4 people
· If you do not have a study group, we will form

   one for you

    ­ Please register via forms we post on Piazza
             Course Project

· If you're taking 11-785, you will do an original project
· If you're taking 11-685, you will do a project "Guided

   Project"
· If you're taking 11-485 this slide does not apply to you

· Projects are intended to exercise your ability to
   comprehend and implement ideas beyond those
   covered by the HWs

· Projects can range from

      · Implementation and evaluation of cutting-edge ideas from recent
          papers

      · Problem-solving that might lead to publication, if completed well
      · New models/learning algorithms/techniques, with proper evaluation
      · Verification of results from "hot" published work

          Lecture Attendance

· You get marks for attendance (i.e. class participation)

      · Our performance metrics over the semesters show a
         distinct correlation between attendance and course scores

      · We also note a distinct inverse correlation between attendance
         and the amount of help you require on piazza and during office hours

      · To encourage attendance, we assign 1 mark for attendance
           · 1% of your total grade for 11685 and 11785
           · 1.3333% of your total grade for 11485
           · This can be the difference between a B and an A

· We will track lecture attendance through Polls
         Recitation 0 & HW1p1

· If you have any doubts about your preparations for
  this course, please, please, please, please go through
  the videos for Recitation-0 and complete the
  notebook exercises

    ­ Gain comfort with the coding required in the homeworks,
        early on

           Reading Materials

· Free resource: 'Dive Into Deep Learning'
  (interactive Jupyter notebooks).

· Recommended: François Chollet's 'Deep
  Learning with Python' (Second Edition)

· Additional reading material will also appear
  on the course pages
               Study groups

· What study groups may do:

     ­ Discuss homework problems and solutions
     ­ Discuss papers
     ­ Discuss class work
     ­ Discuss quizzes

· We encourage you to meet regularly to
   discuss IDL work

· Study groups may also go on to form project
   teams
       Study Group Mentors

· Every study group will be assigned a TA mentor

     ­ We will track your progress and reach out to you if you appear to
          be in trouble

· If in trouble, first reach out to your TA mentor

     ­ If you feel you're falling behind, reach out to your mentor
     ­ If you feel you are struggling, reach out to your mentor
     ­ If you feel pressured/unable to cope, reach out to your mentor
     ­ We will try our best to help you

· We aim to make this a successful course for all of you

     ­ In our intro to deep learning, ID(ea)L world, everyone performs well
          enough to get an A without lowered standards
                ­ i.e. we would like to bring you all up to where we believe you
                deserve an A

     ­ Everything about this course is geared to this objective
       Project Group Mentors

· Every project group will be assigned at least one
   TA mentor

     ­ We will track your progress and be in touch about your
         project status throughout the semester

· You are allowed to seek a "external" mentor who
   has more expertise in your topic of interest

     ­ If you need more guidance and expertise

               Evaluation

· Scores are evaluated based on 3 types of tests:

    · Attendance
    · Weekly Quizzes
    · HW Assignments
    · Team Project or Guided Project (not for 11-485

       students)
      Lecture Attendance: Rules

· You must either attend the lectures in person, or watch via zoom

      ­ With some exceptions: see below
      ­ We get attendance stats from your participation during in-class polls
      ­ Polls will be conducted via Piazza for in-person lectures. It is recommended to use

           the Piazza app available both on Android and iOS.
      ­ Lectures conducted over zoom will use zoom polls
      ­ Use of electronic devices during in-person lectures is not permitted except during

           polls

· Students in SV, and in other time zones where your local time is before
   8am or after 5pm for the class, may alternately watch recorded lectures on
   mediatech instead

      ­ Mediatech records who watched and for how long. Entire lectures must be viewed.
      ­ If viewed on mediatech, the lectures of each week must be viewed before 8AM of

           the Monday following the following week
             ­ Otherwise, it doesn't count

· The precise mechanism for computing the class participation score from
   attendance will be decided at the end of the semester. Our advice to you:
   just attend
            Weekly Quizzes

· Slides often contain a lot more information than

  what is presented in class

· Quizzes will contain questions from topics that are on the

  slides, but not presented in class

· Will also include topics covered in class, but not on online

  slides!

· Sometimes there will be questions based on

  latest research papers in the quiz ­ the links to
  the papers will be provided
           Homework: Part 1

· HW Part-1s evaluate your ability to code neural nets on your own
   from scratch
     ­ If you implement all mandatory and bonus questions of part 1 of all
        homeworks, you will, hopefully, have all components necessary to
        construct a little neural network toolkit of your own
           · "mytorch"

· The homeworks are autograded
     ­ Be careful about following instructions carefully
           · The autograder is setup on a computer with specific versions of
             various packages
           · Your code must conform to their restrictions, if not the
             autograder will often fail and give you errors or 0 marks, even if
             your code is functional on your own computer
     ­ Note: you get some bonus points if you submit the homework early
           Homework: Part 2

· HW Part-2s test your ability to solve complex problems on
 real-world data sets
    · Unlike part-1s, initial early submissions are required and
      worth 10/100 points (to show you have gotten started)
    · The remaining 90/100 points are determined by your
      final score relative to the cutoffs
               Homework: Part 2

· The standard cutoffs are (After 10 pts ESD)

· High cutoff    : 90 pts

· Medium cutoff : 70 pts

· Low cutoff     : 50 pts

· Very Low       : 30 pts

cutoff           : 0 pts

· No submission

· Your score is linearly interpolated between cutoffs. Ex, if an 85%

accuracy model is for the high cutoff and 75% model is for the

medium, a model with 80% accuracy will get 82.5/90 pts

· There is a 5th bonus cutoff for extra credits (10 pts) determined by

  the highest scoring student

     · Ex. If the highest accuracy is 92%, the scoring student will get
       110/100 and anyone between 85% to 92% will get 100+/100
       (assuming they have 10 bonus points from early submission)
             Course Project

· Teams: think about forming project teams as soon as
  possible (we may help, too)

      · 11-785 teams are of 3-4 students maximum
      · 11-685 teams are of 2-3 students maximum

· Project requirements:

      · Report:

               · Submit a project proposal by the proposal deadline listed on the website
               · Submit an initial report 3/4 way through the semester
               · Submit an updated report draft 3 days before the presentation due date
               · Submit a final report during finals week, at the end of the semester

      · Video:

               · Make a 5 min video presentation of the project at the end of the semester
               · The video can be presented by one, some, or all team members
               · Video should explain the problem, proposed solution, and evaluation
               · Defend your project by answering questions about your video, on Piazza

· The project is often the most enjoyable portion of the
  course
                 Grading

* Note: There is 1 mark for attendance
         Homework Deadlines

· There are separate deadlines for Part-1s and Part-2s

· HW Part-2s have multiple deadlines

      · Early Submission Deadline: worth 10% of Part-2 and affirms you have
         started the assignment

      · On-time Submission Deadline: determines your eligibility for full cutoff marks
      · Late/Slack Deadline: everyone gets up to 10 total slack days (does not

         apply to initial submissions, all bonus points, nor HW Part-1s) -- you
         can distribute them as you want across your HWs, and once you use up
         your slack days, all subsequent late submissions will accrue a 10%
         penalty (on top of any other penalties)

· Note: Kaggle: Kaggle leaderboards stop showing updates on

  full-submission deadline

      · We will continue to accept submissions until you run out of slack days (the
         drop-dead deadline)

· Please refer to the course webpage for a complete set of
  policies

    Common Sense Piazza Posts

· Feel free to post on piazza for any clarification or doubts
· We strive to respond to student queries immediately
· With Regards to Code-Related Questions on

  Piazza..

     ­ Make a good title to your question, on the post.
     ­ Describe the problem concisely and clearly.
     ­ Include relevant, short code blocks if necessary... do not

          paste entire notebooks or python files, please!
     ­ Explain your debugging process:

            What you tried, initially (prior to error)
            The results you got
            The errors and expanded stack traces
            What you tried, subsequently (after the error)
            What roadblock are you stuck at now / what do you

               need help understanding?
   Personal and Academic Integrity

· You are here to learn DL yourself, not to demonstrate
   how well you can pretend to learn

· You are at CMU ­ which means you are among the
   brightest and best students in the world

     ­ You probably were among the top students in your peer
         group all your life, before you came here

     ­ It will be an insult to yourself, to lower your integrity

· Try your best, honestly. If you are unsure about
   something, reach out to us
      Integrity and Study Groups

· Every student must solve their quizzes by themselves

     ­ You may discuss the questions with your study groups/friends,
         but when you solve the quiz, isolate yourself and do it alone

· Every student must solve every homework by themselves

     ­ You may discuss the homeworks with your friends, and even
         help them debug their code, but when you finally solve it, every
          line of your code (except libraries that have been okayed by
         course staff) must be written by you

     ­ Your solution must be yours

· Plagiarizing code from the web or your friends constitutes an
   academic integrity violation

     ­ Submitting any solutions not obtained by you constitutes an AIV
