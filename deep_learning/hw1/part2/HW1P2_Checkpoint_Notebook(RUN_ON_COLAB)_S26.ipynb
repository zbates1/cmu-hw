    "Before starting this checkpoint assignment:\n",
    "1. Remember to FREQUENTLY click \"Runtime\" > \"Run All\" or \"Run Before\" to make sure all necessary cells have re-executed after changing your answers.\n",
    "1. You MUST complete the HW1P2 notebook (not this checkpoint notebook) and submit a sufficient score to Kaggle to complete this checkpoint assignment.\n",
    "2. We highly recommend working on this in **GOOGLE COLAB** (set your runtime to CPU-only to save compute units)\n",
    "3. You may submit this to autolab before completing the Kaggle checkpoint to check your quiz answers (You will still need to put your kaggle username and api key). Just make sure you resubmit again later AFTER you have achieved checkpoint cutoff as well.\n",
    "4. Slack days may ONLY be used on P2 final submission. Not Checkpoint submission, and not P1 submissions of any kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes for the competition/submission details:\n",
    "1. Do not attempt to tamper with this submission file. We will require your kaggle username here, and cross-check your autolab score with your official kaggle leaderboard score.\n",
    "2. You are NOT allowed to use any code that will pre-load models (such as those from Hugging Face, etc.).\n",
    "   You MAY use models described by papers or articles, but you MUST implement them yourself through fundamental PyTorch operations (Linear, Conv2d, etc.).\n",
    "3. You are NOT allowed to use any external datasets or data that are not part of this competition at ANY point of the training.\n",
    "4. While you are allowed to work with teammates to run ablations/experiments,\n",
    "   you must submit your OWN code and your OWN results.\n",
    "5. Failure to comply with the prior rules will be considered an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV).\n",
    "6. Late submissions MUST be submitted through the Slack Kaggle (see writeup for details). Any submissions made to the regular Kaggle after the original deadline will NOT be considered, no matter how many slack days remain for the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Final notes:\n",
    "1. A FULL score is required on the MCQ, and kaggle submission must reach the checkpoint cutoff in order to receive 10/10 on this assignment.\n",

However, looking at the training loss and validation accuracy curves as the training progresses, David is surprised to find out that although his training accuracy decreased, his validation accuracy also decreased. Finally, at the end of training the same 10 epochs, the model's validation accuracy is indeed worse. David concludes that dropout is not effective and tries something else.\n",
